Nvidia is a technology company that designs and manufactures graphics processing units (GPUs) and application programming interfaces. Nvidia is dominating the tech market in many fields of Artificial Intelligence and computing. 

## Overview

- Founded on April 5th, 1993, by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Prime.
- Originally named NVision, their name was later changed to Nvidia Corporation.
- Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, and incorporated in Delaware.
- Founded as a graphic processing company, Founders envisioned bringing 3D graphics to the gaming and multimedia markets.
- The founders invested $40,000 to start the company, which received $20M in venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital, Sutter Hill Ventures, and others.


## Business Activities

# Challenges

Nvidia dominates the AI Chip market in the industry today. Their emerging challenge is demand is much bigger than supply. 

Another challenge is Nvidia’s new Blackwell AI chips with accompanying servers overheated, causing clients to worry they will not have enough time to get new data centers up and running.

Revenue Decline Starting in 2026: Projections suggest a downturn in revenue from 2026 onward.
Double-Ordering Among Top Customers: Evidence of double-ordering by at least two of NVIDIA’s top five customers.
Tapering Training Needs: AI training needs are expected to taper off within the next 18 months.
Skeptical Buy-Side Analysts: Analysts are not convinced by the current valuation and are starting to cash out.



# Customer Profile 

Nvidia’s intended customers profile are tech companies in various fields.
Microsoft and Meta are the two biggest customers. Other major clients are Google and Amazon, which each purchased 50,000 Nvidia AI chips in 2023.
The remaining 60% of Nvidia’s business are cloud service providers, including Oracle, CoreWeave, Lambda, and Chinese tech companies Tencent, Baidu, Alibaba, and ByteDance. 
TESLA is one of Nvidia’s major clients.EV maker uses AI computing to train both its driver assistance product and the humanoid robots that Tesla hopes to sell someday.



# Technology

It is an optimized environment for running the Deep Learning, Data Science, and HPC containers available from NVIDIA's NGC Catalog. The Docker containers available on the NGC Catalog are tuned, tested, and certified by NVIDIA to take full advantage of NVIDIA Ampere, Volta, and Turing Tensor Cores, the driving force behind artificial intelligence. Deep Learning, Data Science, and HPC containers from the NGC Catalog require this AMI for the best GPU acceleration on AWS P4D, P3, and G4 instances.
NVIDIA Deep Learning AMI is a tool in the Machine Learning Tools category of a tech stack

Provides AI researchers with fast and easy access to NVIDIA A100, V100, and T4 GPUs in the cloud, with performance-engineered deep learning framework containers that are fully integrated, optimized, and certified by NVIDIA
NVIDIA accelerates innovation by eliminating the complex do-it-yourself task of building and optimizing a complete deep-learning software stack tuned specifically for GPUs
Optimized for highest performance across a wide range of workloads on NVIDIA GPUs
